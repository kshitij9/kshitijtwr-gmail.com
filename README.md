Kshitij Tiwari submission for Testbook assignment: 

I have created a server folder that serves multiple JSON files, with the required data.

I have created a JSONPicker component, which lists the JSON files.

On clicking on a JSON file, the user is redirected to another component ReplayMessages.

In this component, it shows the messages in the ascending order of the timestamp, with a slider that filters the messages according to the timestamp.

HOW TO RUN:

1. run npm install
2. run npm run mock:server
3. run npm start
